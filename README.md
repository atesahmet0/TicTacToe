# TicTacToe
A TicTacToe game app built using javafx. Has its own ai.
Features (Currentln in development):
    Built in ai
    Two player mode
    Online competition via custom made servers
Every graphic in this app is hand-written via Canvas. It may not look majestic but it is much more fun to build this way ! 

UPDATE 22 JAN 2024:
    It turns out too much abstraction is not always a wise decision. I'm currently drowned in boilerplate code.
    Also implementing neural network is complicated and unnecessary than i thought. I will just implement a brute-force
method that iterates through all possible combinations.
    I hope I can afford more time in this project.
